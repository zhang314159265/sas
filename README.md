A x86 assembler.

I decide to use C rather than C++ so it's easy to exclude the C++ lib dependencies and run the assembler on some environment like my SOS operating system.

# Principle
- one should feel very smooth to translate a assembly instruction to machine code by only referring to inst.def.

# Done
- understood every byte in sum.o generated by gnu assembler.

  - 3.3 Comments
    - there are 2 types of commends. One can use `/*` and `*/` to enclose multi-line
      commend or use '#' to start s single line comment.
  - 3.6.1.1 Strings
    - a string is written between double-quotes.
  - 5.3 symbol names
    - for ELF target, symbols start with '.L' are used within the assembler and not
      saved in object files.
    - symbol name can not dupliate (except local lables like '2:') in the same assembly file.
      In a C file, different function may define the same label separately.
      The compiler will assign these labels different names when creating assembly
      file.
    - don't confuse local symbol with local label
  - 7.12 CFI directives
    - [CFI directives in assembly files](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2017/01/18/cfi.html)
      - CFI directives are used to unwind stack for debugger/profiler without saving frame pointers
      - `objdump -W` to dump saved CFI tables
- [DWARF - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF), [STABS - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabs): both are debug information format. But DWARF are more popular than STABS now.

# Scratch

- WIP: convert examples/hello-libc.s to elf
  - TODO: add tests in examples/ to make sure sas can replace gas

- TODO: use relocation to handle label patch

- TODO: support all the assembly instructions in `test_jit_*`
  - `mersenne_number`
  - `harmonic_number`
  - `calc24`

- TODO: think about how to do codegen to handle instructions.

- TODO: gradually use mnemonic for opcode in text code
- TODO: be able to do relocation for circular calls with cycle size > 1
  - f -> f -> f .. has cycle size 1
  - f -> g -> f .. has cycle size 2

- use jit runner to try various programs written in C/asm
  - Try other single-file C programs
    - fib matrix
    - find all a/b/c (`<L`) integer trilples for a right triangle 
    - calc sqrt(x) with binary search / newton iteration
    - calculate md5sum
    - generate random number and use that to estimate PI
    - simple curl (with or without SSL?)
    - simple http server (with or without SSL)
    - MAIL client/server
    - simple ssh client.
    - floating point examples
      - calc pi with some interesting formula
      - (1 + 1/n)^n
      - (1 / 1! + 1 / 2! +...)
      - calc sin with taylor series
      - cos(cos(cos(cos(....)))) -> converge to some number (0.73908..)

- read volume 2 of intel SDM
  - roughly done for chapter 2. content for IA-32e mode and AVX are skipped
	- check mov instruction.
	- next chapter 6.
- TODO: use my assembler to assemble hello.s
